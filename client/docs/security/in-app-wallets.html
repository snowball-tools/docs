# Security: Embedded Wallets

Our wallets are generated by [Turnkey](https://docs.turnkey.com/security/our-approach), which uses a [secure enclave](https://docs.turnkey.com/security/secure-enclaves) approach. This means that private keys are are generated and stored without ever being accessible by your app, Snowball, or Turnkey's general servers.
