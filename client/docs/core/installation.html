## Installation

To get started with Snowball, you need to install the Snowball SDK. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm install @snowballtools/js-sdk
```

Once you have installed the SDK, you can import it into your project and start using it:

```js
import { Snowball } from '@snowballtools/js-sdk';
```

## Import

To use the Snowball SDK, first obtain an API key by signing up on the Snowball website.

Once you have an API key, creating a snowball instance will look similar to the following:

```js
import { Snowball, SnowballChain } from '@snowballtools/js-sdk';

const snowball = Snowball
  .withAuth({
    google: ...,
    passkey: ...,
    // etc.
  })
  .withSmartWallet(...) // Optional
  .create({
    apiKey: 'your-snowball-api-key',
    initialChain: SnowballChain.sepolia,
  })
```

See the next several sections for more information on how to configure the `withAuth` and `withSmartWallet` options.
