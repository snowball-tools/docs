## Auth State

Snowball provides a state object to observe and interact with the current auth state of the user.
This allows your application to easily determine whether or not the user is authenticated, as well as indications of loading and error states.

```js
import { Snowball, SnowballChain } from '@snowballtools/js-sdk';

const snowball = Snowball
  .withAuth({
    google: ...,
  })
  .create({
    apiKey: 'your-snowball-api-key',
    initialChain: SnowballChain.sepolia,
  })


```

Once you have this instance, you have access to several functions that will be useful for integrating Snowball into your application.

## `snowball.chain`

Gets an instance of a SnowballChain, which represents the current chain that the user is interacting with.

```js
const chain = snowball.chain
```

## `snowball.auth`

Gets a mapping of the auth providers that are currently enabled.

For example, if you defined `google: ...` in the `withAuth` function, you can access the Google auth provider like so:

```js
const google = snowball.auth.google
```

This value will be typed to the specific auth provider that you defined in the `withAuth` function.
