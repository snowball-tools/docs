## General Usage

Regardless of which auth, smart wallet, and onboarding/offboarding providers you choose, your Snowball SDK usage will look similar to the following:

```js
import { Snowball, SnowballChain } from '@snowballtools/js-sdk'

const snowball = Snowball
  .withAuth({
    google: ...,
    passkey: ...,
    // etc.
  })
  .withSmartWallet(...) // Optional
  .create({
    apiKey: 'your-snowball-api-key',
    initialChain: SnowballChain.sepolia,
  })
```

Once you have this instance, you have access to several functions that will be useful for integrating Snowball into your application.

## `snowball.chain`

Gets an instance of a SnowballChain, which represents the current chain (mainnet, sepolia, etc.) that the user is interacting with.

```js
const chain = snowball.chain
```

## `snowball.switchChain(newChain)`

Switch to a new SnowballChain, which represents the current chain that the user is interacting with.

```js
import { SnowballChain } from '@snowballtools/js-sdk'

const snowball = ...

snowball.switchChain(SnowballChain.sepolia)
```

## `snowball.auth`

Gets a mapping of the auth providers that are currently enabled.

For example, if you defined `passkey: ...` in the `withAuth` function, you can access the Passkey auth provider like so:

```js
const passkeyAuth = snowball.auth.passkey
```

This value will be typed to the specific auth provider that you defined in the `withAuth` function.
