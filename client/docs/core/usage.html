## General Usage

Regardless of which auth, smart wallet, and onboarding/offboarding providers you choose, your Snowball SDK usage will look similar to the following:

```js
import { Snowball, SnowballChain } from '@snowballtools/js-sdk';

export const snowball = Snowball
  .withAuth({
    google: ...,
    passkey: ...,
  })
  .withSmartWallet(...) // Optional
  .create({
    apiKey: 'your-snowball-api-key',
    initialChain: SnowballChain.sepolia,
  })
```

Once you have this instance, you have access to several functions that will be useful for integrating Snowball into your application.

## `snowball.chain`

Gets an instance of a SnowballChain, which represents the current chain that the user is interacting with.

```js
const chain = snowball.chain
```

## `snowball.auth`

Gets a mapping of the auth providers that are currently enabled.

For example, if you defined `google: ...` in the `withAuth` function, you can access the Google auth provider like so:

```js
const google = snowball.auth.google
```

This value will be typed to the specific auth provider that you defined in the `withAuth` function.
