# Embedded Wallets: Concepts

Before diving into the technical details of embedded wallets, let's go over how your application interacts with Snowball's embedded wallets
at a high level.

Below are the four core moving pieces:

<diagram src="/img/diagrams/concept-schema.png" max-height="400px" />

- **User** – A user of your application
- **Auth Provider** – Either a social login provider (Google, Twitter, etc.) or an email address where One Time Passwords (OTPs) are sent for authentication.
- **Wallet** – The public/private keypair generated for the user, attached to their auth provider (email, Twitter account, etc).
- **Passkey** – How the user signs transactions with their wallet. This is how the user manages fully custody of their wallet.

Now let's dig deeper into each piece to learn how it all fits together.

## User

This is a record on Snowball's servers. It represents a user of your onchain application. The fields of a user record include:

- `uid` – A unique string identifier
- `created_at` – The unix timestamp of when the user was created

## Auth Provider

An auth provider is how a user authenticates themselves.

Currently Snowball only supports email auth. Social auth and phone number auth are coming soon.

### Wallet Generation

The first time your user connects their auth provider to your Snowball Build Account, a wallet keypair is securely generated for them.

Every time the user logs in after that, Snowball recognizes the user and returns their wallet public key.

For security details about how Snowball does wallet generation, and how Snowball ensures it never has access to your user's private keys,
see our [Security: Embedded Wallets](/docs/security/embedded-wallets) docs.

## Wallet

A generated wallet (derived from an auth provider + Snowball Build Account) is a fully-functioning Ethereum account.
It has both a public key (address) and a private key.
