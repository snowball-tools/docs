# Introduction to In-App Wallets

In-app wallets are a **new type of wallet** that *modernize* the use of onchain applications. They significantly improve the ux of a user managing their own funds:

In a nutshell, in-app wallets keep your users **on *your* app** instead of sending them back and forth between your app and a 3rd party wallet app.

## Benefits

In-app wallets are **seamless**. They provide a **native experience** for the user, as they are integrated directly into your app. This means:

- You can generate a wallet for the user without them needing to install a wallet app.
- The user **does not** need to write down (and potentially lose!) the typical 12-word seed phrase attached to their wallet.
- A user never needs to leave your app to manage their funds.

In-app wallets are **secure** and **non-custodial**. In other words, a user is in *full control* of their wallet, due to:

- Both Snowball and your app never gain access to your user's private keys.
- The user's action/consent is required to initiate transactions.
- The user's passkeys are securely managed by their device.

In-app wallets are **recoverable**.

- The user can recover their wallet using their original auth method (e.g. email) in the case they lose access to their passkeys.
- The user always has the option to securily export their private key.

## Implications

With in-app wallets, you can build defi apps that are more **user-friendly** and **secure** than ever before. And with Snowball, you can launch your next app today.
