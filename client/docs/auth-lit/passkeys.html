## Using with Lit Passkey Auth

Lit provides a simple way to integrate passkeys authentication into your application.
This guide will walk you through the process of setting up user passkeys authentication with Lit.

## Getting Started

First ensure you've installed the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install @snowballtools/js-sdk @snowballtools/auth-lit
```

Then initialize Snowball with passkey auth:

```js
import { Snowball, SnowballChain } from '@snowballtools/js-sdk'
import { LitPasskeyAuth } from '@snowballtools/auth-lit'

const snowball = Snowball.withAuth({
  passkey: LitPasskeyAuth.configure({
    litRelayApiKey: 'your-lit-relay-api-key',
  })
}).create({
  apiKey: 'your-snowball-api-key',
  initialChain: SnowballChain.sepolia
});
```

## Usage

There are two key points you need to interact with passkey auth:

1. Creating a passkey with `register(username)`
2. Authenticating with a passkey with `authenticate`

Note that these are functions on the `snowball.auth.passkey` object, so you would access them like so:

```js
snowball.auth.passkey.register('someUsername')
snowball.auth.passkey.authenticate()
```
